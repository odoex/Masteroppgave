function [G] = finiteVolume(G,a,b,t_0,t_n,f)
% finiteVolume Function running the finite volume scheme.
%   This function takes a grid, a time interval and information about the
%   advection PDE whose solution is to be approximated by the finite volume
%   method. While still inside the time interval the solution is
%   approximated at the current time step on the current grid G (starting
%   at the coarsest grid) with Runge-Kutta 4. The time step for this grid
%   is updated to the time it was last calculated. If this grid has a finer
%   grid, the solution for this grid is recursively calculated with this
%   method.
