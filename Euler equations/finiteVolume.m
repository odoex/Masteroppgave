function [G] = finiteVolume(G,t_0,t_n)
% finiteVolume Function running the finite volume scheme.
%   This function takes a grid and a time interval as parametres. While 
%   still inside the time interval the solution is
%   approximated at the current time step on the current grid G (starting
%   at the coarsest grid) with Runge-Kutta 4. The time step for this grid
%   is updated to the time it was last calculated. If this grid has a finer
%   grid, the solution for this grid is recursively calculated with this
%   method.
